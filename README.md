# Medical Patient Data Logger - Front end interface

Medical Patient Data Logger is an AngularJS web application front end interface that can be used by software professionals working towards creating applications that log patient data.

It provides a responsive and interactive user interface that lets a user input the patient's personal details and diagnosis details and views the data at the end in a summary layout.
The data is currently saved in a global variable called **unifiedDataModel** and outputs to console when the submit button is clicked.
